# Face Mask  Detection

### It is a personal project. Here, I had applied Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a dataset to train the model.
<br>

#### Dataset
The dataset had been downloaded from Kaggle.
Dataset Link: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset"> Dataset Link</a>
<br>

#### Model
In the CNN model, 6 conv2D layers, 6 pooling layers, 1 flatten layer and 2 dense layers have been used.
<br>

#### Output Result:
